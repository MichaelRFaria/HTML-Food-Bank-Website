        <p>
          Community Table was established in 2018 by local organiser
          <strong>Maya Patel</strong> and chef <strong>David Green</strong> as a
          neighbourhood initiative to tackle
          <em>food insecurity and social isolation</em> in the heart of
          <strong>East London</strong>. What began as a small food bank and soup
          kitchen in a church hall has evolved into a vibrant community hub
          where people cook, share, and learn together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Community Kitchen runs a <strong>zero-waste café</strong>,
          weekly <strong>community meals</strong>, and
          <strong>cooking workshops</strong> that celebrate seasonal,
          affordable, and culturally diverse food. <em>All proceeds</em> go back
          into supporting local families through meal donations, skills
          training, and volunteer opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognised for its innovative approach to
          <em>social sustainability</em>, Community Kitchen received the
          <strong>London Food Roots Award (2023)</strong> and continues to
          partner with local growers and surplus suppliers to ensure that no
          good food goes to waste.
