          Community Table was established in 2018 by local organiser Maya Patel
          and chef David Green as a neighbourhood initiative to tackle
          <em>food insecurity and social isolation</em> in the heart of East
          London. What began as a small food bank and soup kitchen in a church
          hall has evolved into a vibrant community hub where people cook,
          share, and learn together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Community Kitchen runs a <em>zero-waste</em> café, weekly
          community meals, and cooking workshops that celebrate seasonal,
          affordable, and culturally diverse food. <em>All proceeds</em> go back
          into supporting local families through meal donations, skills
          training, and volunteer opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognised for its innovative approach to
          <em>social sustainability</em>, Community Kitchen received the
          <strong>London Food Roots Award (2023)</strong> and continues to
          partner with local growers and surplus suppliers to ensure that no
          good food goes to waste.
