          Community Table was established in 2018 by local organiser Maya Patel
          and chef David Green as a neighbourhood initiative to tackle food
          insecurity and social isolation in the heart of East London. What
          began as a small food bank and soup kitchen in a church hall has
          evolved into a vibrant community hub where people cook, share, and
          learn together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Community Kitchen runs a zero-waste café, weekly community
          meals, and cooking workshops that celebrate seasonal, affordable, and
          culturally diverse food. All proceeds go back into supporting local
          families through meal donations, skills training, and volunteer
          opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognised for its innovative approach to social sustainability,
          Community Kitchen received the London Food Roots Award (2023) and
          continues to partner with local growers and surplus suppliers to
          ensure that no good food goes to waste.
