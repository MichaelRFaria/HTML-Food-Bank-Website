          "Community Table isn’t just about food — it’s about dignity. When I
          first came here, I was struggling to feed my kids. Now I volunteer
          twice a week, and it feels like being part of a big, caring family."
        </p>
        <p>— Amira, Local Resident & Volunteer</p>

          "The meals are nourishing, but the real magic is the sense of
          belonging. Everyone is welcome, and you can feel that from the moment
          you walk in."
        </p>
        <p>— John P., Regular Guest</p>

          "Our partnership with Community Table has shown how local businesses
          can make a real difference. Their zero-waste ethos aligns perfectly
          with our sustainability goals."

          "I joined a community cooking session not knowing anyone. Now I’ve
          made friends, learned new recipes, and gained the confidence to cook
          for others."
        </p>
        <p>— Daniel, Workshop Participant</p>

          "Community Table is the kind of project every neighbourhood needs —
          practical, kind, and deeply human. It shows what’s possible when
          people come together around food."
        </p>
        <p>— Councillor Rachel D’Souza, Hackney Council</p>

          "I’ve volunteered at a few community kitchens, but this one stands
          out. The organisation, the inclusivity, and the atmosphere are
          incredible. It feels like a home."
        </p>
        <p>— Leo, Volunteer Chef</p>

          "For me, Community Table has been a lifeline. It’s more than a meal —
          it’s a conversation, a place to laugh, and a reminder that you’re not
          alone."
        </p>
